# Global Population Distribution (World Bank WDI)

This project analyzes the distribution of total population by country using the World Bank World Development Indicators dataset for the indicator `SP.POP.TOTL` ("Population, total").

The analysis focuses on:
- How country populations are distributed globally.
- Which countries dominate the global population in the latest year available. 

## Repository Structure

- `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_321661.csv`  
  Raw World Bank export containing total population by country and year. 

- `population_distribution.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook that:
  - Loads and cleans the dataset.  
  - Selects the latest available year.  
  - Builds a histogram of country populations (log scale).  
  - Builds a bar chart of the top 15 most populous countries.  
  - Exports a high-quality combined figure as `population_histogram_bar.png`.

- `population_analysis.py`  
  Standalone Python script that performs the same analysis and regenerates the figure for automation/CI workflows. 

- `population_histogram_bar.png`  
  High-resolution image showing:
  - Left: distribution of country populations across all countries.  
  - Right: top 15 countries by total population in the latest year. 

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: 
2. Ensure `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_321661.csv` is in the project root. 
3. To regenerate the figure via script:

4. To explore interactively:
- Open `population_distribution.ipynb` in Jupyter.
- Run all cells to reproduce the histogram and bar chart and save `population_histogram_bar.png`.
